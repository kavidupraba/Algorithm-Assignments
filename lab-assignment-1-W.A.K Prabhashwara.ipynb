    "## Laboration 1: Experiments with the execution time of programs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Juypyter notebook that contains text, links and Python code for the first assignment of the course. The assignment is designed as a laboration with several exercises that build on each other. The purpose of the laboration is to provide you with the opportunity to practice programming in Python and to relate to the analysis of execution time of algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This laboration is part of the examination of the course. There are instructions on how to submit, including deadlines and advice, in the Blackboard site for the course. Please follow these instructions. There you can also see what is needed in order to pass. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise is clearly marked as such, but before the exercise you will find explanations and code that you need to use in your solution to the exercise. Please read the notebook from top to bottom: do not go the the exercise cell directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises become more and more difficult, the idea is that you can start with the first three exercises almost immediatelly. You should get a feeling for Python as you go. Please make sure you understand what you are expected to do: give it a try, if there is something you do not understand, ask your teachers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will practice\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get to use basic constructs in Python: expressions, assignments, if-statements, for-loops, while-loops and functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you will get to use some modules (sometimes called libraries) with useful functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The library ```random``` that you access by running ```import random``` once. Some of the functions we will use are:\n",
    "  - ```random.randrange(low, high)``` that returns a random integer number in the interval $[low, high)$\n",
    "  - ```random.shuffle(a)``` that shuffles the elements in the array a in place (it modifies a).\n",
    "* The library ```time``` that you access by running ```import time``` once. This library provides functions that return a timestamp. You can then use the difference between two timestamps to obtain the elapsed time. We will use the functions:\n",
    "  - ```time.process_time()``` \n",
    "  - ```time.process_time_ns()```\n",
    "  \n",
    "You will gain experience in having to read code written by someone else and having to add functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will even practice understanding a high level description of an algorithm and follow the steps needed to implement it in Python. This algorithm is **Quicksort**, one of the best known algorithms in computer science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the goal of the laboration is to convince you that the very abstract way of calculating execution time of algorithms using Big-O notation is in fact related to the actual execution time of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning an array\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by showing Python code to reorder the elements of an array so that three elements get sorted: the first element, the element in the middle position and the last element. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to sort the three elements we need to identify the middle position and we need to be able to swap elements. \n"

    "    \n",
    "c)  If we change test_case to a one-element list like test_case= [1] This list is already sorted because there is nothing to sort and this list first element test_case[0]=test_case[mid]=test_case[n].    \n",
    "\n",
    "If we change test_case to a two-element list like test_case=[2,1] the sort_three(a, I,j) function will sort this list because test_case[0]>test_case[n] and this will trigger the condition in our sort_three(a, I,j) function “if a[n] < a[0]:” so the final sorted test_case=[1,2] again this depend on our input list lets say we give already sorted list  example test_case=[1,2] this will not going to trigger any conditions inside sort_three(a, I,j) function because it is already sorted lets take our previous example for two-element list test_case=[2,1] in this case test_case[0]=2, test_case[mid]=2, test_case[n]=1 in here n=len(test_case)-1=2-1=1 and mid=n//2=1//2=0 so test_case[0]=test_case[mid]=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another test_case with three elements like test_case= [3,2,1] here the sort_three (a, I,j) will going to sort this list completely because according to our 1 question answer the sort_three(a, I,j) will sort only three elements(first, middle, last) and this list only has 3 elements in here test_case[0]=3,n=len(test_case)-1=3-1=2 and test_case[n]=test_case[2]=1, mid=n//2=2//2=1 and test_case[mid]=2 and this list we choose for this example will be going to trigger all the conditions in sort_three(a,I,j) function because test_case[mid]<test_case[0]  this will trigger “if a[mid]<a[0]:” and test_case[n]<test_case[mid] this will trigger “if a[n] < a[0]:” also test_case[n]<test_case[mid] this will trigger “if a[n]<a[mid]:” now let's go through this step by step after first condition triggering test_case[mid]=3 and test_case[0]=2 now our new list will be like this test_case=[2,3,1] according to this our new test_case[0]=2 and test_case[mid]=3 and test_case[n]=1 after second condition triggering test_case[n]=2 and test_case[0]=1 now our new list will be like this test_case=[1,3,2] according to this test_case[0]=1,test_case[mid]=3,test_case[n]=2 after third condition triggering test_case[n]=3 and test_case[mid]=2 now our list will be fully sorted (test_case=[1,2,3]) again this will be dependent on what is our list look like (how is the position of element in list with three elements lets say we get a list like test_case=[1,2,3] this is already sorted not going to trigger any condition and if took list like test_case=[1,3,2] this will going to trigger the last condition ”if a[n]<a[mid]:”).\n",

    "here “i” searches the left side of the pivot (checking if there is any element bigger than the pivot that exists on the left side of the list). In contrast “j” searches the right side of the pivot  (checking if there is any element smaller than the pivot exists on the right side of the list) if element i, fulfills the conditions of “ if a[i]>=pivot” the second loop will run until “j” full fill condition “if a[j] <= pivot:” after that swap function swaps the location of the element assigned to “i” and “j” and the main while loop will break at the moment i>=j the thing in here is the” i” will end up facing the larger elements than pivot position it end up facing the right side of the list in this code we change our pivot value position beforehand to the index before the last index (high -1) (so it will not get in the way of our search) and this “i” will be the true index position of the pivot value. Hence, we use the swap function to move it to its rightful place.\n",
    "Okay in this explanation we can see that we searched the whole list that is divided into two sides using pivot value as the dividing point and we searched through it one time so this partition(a, lo, hi)  when the element count becomes larger the search area also becomes bigger  because of this 1000,000 element list will take more time(compare to 10 element list)  according to our example pivot value: 908671 as division point the function go through 999,999 elements to check if they were bigger than 908671 or smaller than 908671 this function divide list then it only going through the list for one time it has BigO of O(n-3) \n",
    "(-3 because we increase i+=1 before comparing it with pivot this will skip the first element in the list while decrease j-=1 before comparing it with pivot this will skip the chance to compare last element with pivot value but this is not a problem because before we using  partition(a,lo,hi) we make sure that a[0]<a[mid]<a[hi] using sort_three(a,low,hi) )time complexity = O(n)(we drop the -3 because -3 will negligible compare to ever growing n value)  loop with n number of element  time-complexity will be O(n)\n",

    "d)If we still use the “sort_three(a,low,hi)” function here just like explained in Exercise Part 3 the list with one element, two elements, and three elements will be sorted by the “sort_three(a,low,hi)” function before it will get into the point of the “partition(a,lo,hi) “ function.\n",
    "But let's say we don’t use “sort_three (a, low, hi)” Then the list with one element as we discussed before will be already sorted because it only has one element and the pivot value will be this element and there is nothing to sort around it so i=0 and j=-1 that means j is also pointing at the same element from the other side of the list (reading from the backside of the list) so a[i], a[j]=0 ( if we use list(range(1))  and there is an increment “i+=1” inside first nested while loop before our comparison condition (if a[i] >= pivot:) so this increment will increase the value of i to 1 before we go through the condition (if a[i] >= pivot:) this will trigger an error called index out of range why? because we have 1 element and its index is 0 but we searching for index 1 (that means we searching element that is nonexistent in this list) “We will face this problem even if we use sort_three(a,low,hi) this is not a problem of sort_three(a,low,hi) function this is problem inside the partition(a,lo,hi) to solve this we can change to main while loop and nested while loop to this :\n",
    "“    while i < j:  # i,j always stay outside of the pivot point (pivot index)\n",
    "        # that means they should never cross each other i should stay left side of the pivot point\n",
    "        # while j should stay right side of the pivot point(pivot index) PIVOT INDEX WILL BE THE i value when\n",
    "        # wile loop stop i  stop facing larger element to the pivot point and we replaced pivot at hi-1\n",

    "    return i”\n",
    "this will give while loop running condition i<j and all the nested loops now have their own conditions to run  and solve the problem that arises from increment and decrement before comparing elements with pivot \n",
    "after this correction, we get the output of the sorted list as a=[0] (we used list(range(1)) to create this list) \n",
    "\n",
    "let's take a list with 2 elements (a=[1,0] we use list(range(1))) we discussed before this list will sorted through sort_three(a,low,hi) (a=[0,1] ) let's go through the partition(a,lo,hi) at the beginning of this function we get mid, pivot value=a[0]=0 and swap it with hi-1 position according to this list that position is 0 index that means now we swapping same element inside same index so this is not do anything list still be the same [0,1] but after that inside  nested while loop we see the same increment before i+=1 after that we face the condition “if a[i]>=pivote:break”\n",
    "in this case, a[1]=1>0 so the nested while loop going to break, and then we go inside to the next while loop here there is a decrement j-=1after that we face the condition “if a[j]<=pivote:break:” in this case, a[0]=0=0 so this loop also going to break but this will not going to trigger the swap(a,low,hi) because we can see there is a condition to break the main while loop if i>j: break\n",
    "after that we going to change our pivot position through swap(a,i=1,hi-1=1-1=0) after this swap our list will be like a=[1,0]  CONCLUSION: if we use a two-element list partition(a,lo,hi) not going to sort the list \n",
    "“we can fix this problem by changing the while loop like when we did in a list with  one element case”\n",
    "Let's take a list with three elements (a=[2,1,0] we use list(range(3))) as we discussed before this list will be going to be sorted when it goes through sort_three(a,low,hi) function [0,1,2] ok let's go through partition(a,lo,hi) in this case middle pivot will be  1 and we going to swap this with hi-1=1 so the elements will going to swap in the same place after that we go through the while loops i+=1 a[i=1]=1>=1 this will break the first nested loop then j-=1 a[j=0]=0<=1this will break the second nested loop but after that i=1>j=0 this will break the main nested loop after that we put pivot in it’s place swap(a,low=i=1,hi=hi-1=2-1=1) so same element will swap in same place nothing happen \n",
    "CONCLUSION: in this case, the   partition(a,lo,hi) will do nothing and we can’t check another case because we have to fulfill a[lo] <= a[mid] <= a[hi] use partition(a,lo,hi) when we fulfilling this condition we automatically sort the list\n",
